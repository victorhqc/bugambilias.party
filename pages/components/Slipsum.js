      Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses
      differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you
      and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our
      lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same
      curve, just on opposite ends.{' '}

      Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus
      to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks.
      Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker,
      know what I'm sayin'?{' '}

      Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a
      comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite
      of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back
      when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.{' '}

      Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as
      the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the
      little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually
      proud of that shit.{' '}

      Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this
      shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I
      can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much
      shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.{' '}

      Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they
      show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide
      if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs.
      Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.{' '}

      My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there,
      and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there.
      Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna
      tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in
      there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get
      shot. You understand?{' '}
